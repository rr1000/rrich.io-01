  <p class="mb-4">I specialize in privacy, security, compliance, and software design. I'm currently the CTO at <a href="https://www.haekka.com" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Haekka</a>, a Slack-based training platform that is quickly becoming the new paradigm in security awareness built for modern work. Haekka allows organizations to intelligently train their workforce with the right content at the right time â€” entirely from the tools they already use.  
  <p class="mb-4">Previously, I served as Chief Product and Security Officer at Datica, leading the development of a secure Kubernetes platform. Datica was acquired in 2019. Earlier, I co-founded a startup using optical character recognition to assist educators in grading, pre-dating popular AI trends. I hold an Applied Science degree from <a href="https://rit.edu" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">R.I.T.</a></p>
