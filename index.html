            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>My name is Ryan Rich. I’m a product and technology leader focused on building meaningful products and high-powered engineering teams.</p>
            <p>I have a particular focus on privacy, security and regulatory compliance.</p>
            <p>I’m currently working on a newly funded venture called <a href="https://www.haekka.com">Haekka</a>. Before that, I was the Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://datica.com">Datica</a> where I helped organizations protect healthcare information in the cloud.</p>
            <p>Before Datica, I co-founded a startup that helped educators streamline their grading process with the assistance of their mobile device. Utilizing optical character recognition technology (way before things like machine learning and AI were cool), I helped college professors drastically improve their grading process, allowing them to spend more time educating.</p>
            <p>I live in Portland Oregon with my wife, daughter, dog and two cats.</p>
