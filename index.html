                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Ryan — an entrepreneur, engineer, and designer focused on building and growing software companies.</p>
                <p>My expertise lies at the intersections of privacy, security, regulatory compliance and software design. I'm currently working on <a href="https://www.haekka.com" target="_blank">Haekka</a>, a training platform designed to meet requirements for HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI, GDPR, CCPA, and everything in between. Haekka was created to work entirely in Slack.</p>
                <p>Before Haekka, I was Chief Product and Security Officer at <a href="https://datica.com" target="_blank">Datica</a> where I helped organizations protect and integrate healthcare information in the cloud. I lead the creation, design and implementation of a secure Kubernetes platform. Datica was acquired in 2019.</p>
                <p>Before Datica, I co-founded a startup that helped educators streamline their grading process with the assistance of their mobile device. Utilizing optical character recognition technology (way before things like machine learning and AI were cool), I helped college professors drastically improve their grading process, allowing them to spend more time educating.</p>
                <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank">R.I.T.</a> in 2013 with a degree in Applied Science.</p>
