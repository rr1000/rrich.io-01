      <p><strong>Hello.</strong></p>
      <p>My name is Ryan Rich. I'm the Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://datica.com" target="_blank">Datica</a> where I help organizations large and small protect healthcare information in the cloud. At Datica I'm responsible for product design, strategy, and management. Previous to becoming CPO at Datica I was VP of Product, as well as Director of Design where I helped build out product and design functions.</p>
      <p>Before Datica I worked with brands like Volkswagen, Ducati and Monumental sports to help them build technology and automate their digital marketing strategies. Previous to my brand strategy work, I co-founded a startup that helped educators streamline their grading process with the help of their mobile device. Utilizing optical character recognition technology (way back before things like machine learning and AI were cool), we helped college professors drastically improve their grading times, allowing them to spend more time educating.</p>
      <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank">R.I.T.</a> with a B.S. in applied science. I currently live in Portland, OR with my wife, 2 cats and 1 dog.</p>
