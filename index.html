        <div class="long-text">
            <p>I'm the Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://datica.com" taget="_blank">Datica</a> where I help organizations large and small protect healthcare information in the cloud. At Datica I'm responsible for product design, strategy, and management. </p>
            <p>Previous to becoming CPO at Datica I was VP of Product, as well as Director of Design at Catalyze where I helped build product and design functions.</p>
            <p>Before Datica & Catalyze I worked with brands like Volkswagen and Ducati on automating their digital marketing strategies.</p>
            <p>Previous to my brand strategy work, I co-founded a startup that helped educators streamline their grading process with the assistance of their mobile device. Utilizing optical character recognition technology (way back before things like machine learning and AI were cool), we helped college professors drastically improve their grading times, allowing them to spend more time educating.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m passionate about building products at the intersection security, privacy, and autonomy. I graduated from R.I.T. with a B.S. in applied science. I currently reside in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
