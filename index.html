                <h5>Datica</h5>
                <p>Up until March 2020, I was the Chief Product Officer at <a href="https://datica.com" target="_blank">Datica</a> where I helped organizations large and small protect healthcare information in the cloud. As CPO I was responsible for product design, strategy, and management. Previously at Datica, I built out product and design functions as VP of Product and Director of Design.</p>
                <h5>Global Thinking</h5>
                <p>Before Datica I worked with brands like Volkswagen and Ducati on automating their digital marketing strategies.</p>
                <h5>Gradesnap</h5>
                <p>My career started by co-founding a startup that helped educators streamline their grading process with the assistance of their mobile device. Utilizing optical character recognition technology (way back before things like machine learning and AI were cool), we helped college professors drastically improve their grading times, allowing them to spend more time educating.</p>
                <p>Iâ€™m passionate about building products at the intersection security, privacy, and autonomy. I graduated from R.I.T. with a B.S. in applied science and currently reside in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
