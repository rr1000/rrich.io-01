Investors, mentors, and fellow founders often advise against tailoring features or functionality for just a handful of customers (let along a single customer!). However, it's often required to land those big initial contracts (make your product 10x for 1 customer as opposed to 1x for 10 customers). Imagine chasing a significant contract, and the prospective client requires an integration with some bespoke internal software. This could be the perfect chance to develop the groundwork for a public API, benefiting not only that client but potentially other customers. Within these one-offs lie innovations that can enhance your software for everyone. So, rather than shying away, embrace the opportunity to build that custom feature.
