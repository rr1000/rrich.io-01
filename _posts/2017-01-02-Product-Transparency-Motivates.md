### Transparency around your product can motivate people and ultimately be the driving mechanism for innovative product development.

Humans have a natural disposition to perform better at their job when they care about the work they are doing. This isn’t a new revelation. Positivity, happiness, self-worth, and time investment all play a major role in motivating people to achieve their potential within a given occupation.

A product will only ever be as good as the #Team you assemble around it. As obvious as that might sound it’s something that many #Entrepreneurs and #Managers still fail at. The ones that fail, believe their #Vision and #Strategy will build and drive the product. In reality that’s not true. The best products in the world have the best teams in the world. Those teams are driven by a crystal clear vision of the product.
