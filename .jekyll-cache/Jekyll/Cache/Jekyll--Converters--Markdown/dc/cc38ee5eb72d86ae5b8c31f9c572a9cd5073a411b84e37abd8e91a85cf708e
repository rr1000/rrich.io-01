<p>Before switching to #Notion, I struggled to pull together a set of reliable #[[Productivity Tools]] over the years. Generally, Iâ€™d find a new note taking app or a new todo app every 6-9 months, never sticking with anything beyond a year.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to put to words what exactly I didnâ€™t like about any one tool I used. What I suspect was going on was that subconsciously I wasnâ€™t happy, for whatever reason, and my mind was on this artificial timeline. So when six months rolled around, Iâ€™d feel the urge to go googling for whatever was being billed as the next great tool.</p>

<p>In this #Article, Iâ€™ll briefly cover how I started using #Notion, and then give a more in-depth overview of how I use Notion today.</p>

<strong>Notion ca. 2015 - source: archive.org</strong></p>

<p>I first remember Notion from when I attempted to use it in late 2015. I didnâ€™t really know what it was at the time. Someone had initially floated it to me as an alternative to Confluence, but I knew my company wasnâ€™t ready to move away from Confluence yet. Even for personal use, I didnâ€™t see the draw. I had Google docs, I had Things for tracking tasks and I had Evernote for taking notes.</p>

<strong>Notion today - source: notion.so</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward a few years and I found Notion yet again. By then I had gone through several iterations of my productivity stack, having used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things 3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/">TaskPaper</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://agenda.com/">Agenda</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://authorapp.co/">Author</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://macdown.uranusjr.com/">MacDown</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ulysses.app/">Ulysses</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://25.io/mou/">Mou</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and moreâ€¦</p>

<p>Not joking, Iâ€™ve used literally every single one of these apps extensively. ^^The core problem that I was trying to solve was integration. All of these tools had components that worked great, but none of them were integrated, or connected to any other apps in meaningful ways^^. Taking a note in Simplenote felt meaningless when I couldnâ€™t connect it to a task in Things 3, or expand on it in a MacDown document. Yes, I could copy and manually tie all of these tools together via tagging, and organizing, but thatâ€™s a nightmare.</p>

<p>So in January 2019, I started using Notion and Iâ€™ve not looked back since. It has solved every problem that Iâ€™ve had with any other tool. It supports #Markdown, complex media types, #Taxonomy, organization, #Templates, and much more.</p>

<p><strong>My Notion settings</strong></p>

<h3 id="icon">Icon</h3>

<p>Create a custom #Icon. It looks better than an #Emoji, or at the very least use an image for your Notion space icon. It gives your space character. Youâ€™re going to be looking at this app almost every day, youâ€™ll want to introduce character where you can.</p>

<h3 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m a #[[Dark Mode]] purist. I have dark mode on by default for any app that allows it, and I generally gravitate towards apps that have darker UIs. I donâ€™t know if this is a habit from using a code editor for years, but I prefer the way it looks and itâ€™s easier on the eyes.</p>

<h3 id="members">Members</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m on the Notion personal plan ($4/m), which only allows one user. This has made collaboration with my wife a bit difficult at times because she doesnâ€™t use it enough to justify the $16/m it would cost me. I do wish Notion would introduce a family plan.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for settings. Notion doesnâ€™t have any extensive nobs or levers to pull just yet. I am hoping they release an API in early 2020 for building integrations and even using Notion as a CMS.</p>

<h3 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy</h3>

<p>My notion space is split into two working sections, Personal and Work. I use these labels as tags and generally any top-level item gets tagged with either. The two exceptions are Launchpad, which is where I start the day. and Templates, which is where I store all of my templates. Everything else is either work or personal related.</p>

<h3 id="launchpad">Launchpad</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cc01f3d-b274-4935-b976-e8a7cbeebbed_2350x1412.png" alt="Notion" /></p>

<p><strong>Launchpad - where I start the day</strong></p>

<p>To start my day I typically go through my emails, making todo tasks for follow-ups, and organizing those tasks by priority. From there I will go through the rest of my backlog of todos and figure out what I need to work on that day. Beyond that, itâ€™s a blur of meetings, Slack discussions, and general startup chaos. Because of this, I need a solid foundation on which to start my day. Launchpad provides that foundation. From the most important links, to internal/external documentation. My Launchpad has everything I need to get going.</p>

<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>

<p>#Templates in Notion can be very powerful. Once Iâ€™ve settled on an #Outline that I like, Iâ€™ll save it as a template and store it in the Templates directory. From there, I can create copies of it for use within a Notion directory. If youâ€™re not familiar with <a href="https://www.notion.so/Create-your-own-templates-5c033c12ac3b4c1fb4703491be74550d">Notionâ€™s template button</a>, it allows you to quickly produce a series of page blocks either as their own separate page or as elements on an existing page.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>In the future, I plan to leverage Notionâ€™s #API (hopefully coming soon) to manage all of my content across personal, work, and web spaces. I plan to manage website content, social media content, and even product-related content, centrally with Notion. This would bring Notion closer to <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> in terms of functionality, but with a far superior #UX.</p>
