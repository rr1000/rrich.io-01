<p>Think of a human as the trunk to a tree. The core branches of that tree are the <strong>stuff</strong> that keeps us alive â€” sleep, sustenance, shelter, money, health, etc. A marketâ€™s proximity to these essential branches determines the potential of capitalistic success. Spanning these branches means an even higher likelihood of success.</p>

<p>The further up the tree you go, the smaller the #Market becomes until eventually, you donâ€™t have a viable market. The trick is to not mistake your market for your #Niche. Starting with a small subset of a larger market is a niche. You create a product that a small number of people rely on. You make it so good that userâ€™s evangelize it. Then you grow to meet the needs of the larger market.</p>

<p>Issues arise when you conflate your niche and your market. What you may think is your niche, may end up being the entire size of your market and then youâ€™re in trouble.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve witnessed this happen first hand. Youâ€™re building a #Product, youâ€™re talking to #Customers, youâ€™re shipping code, youâ€™re improving the #Design â€” it feels like you are hitting #[[Product Market Fit (PMF)]]â€¦and then the #Sales fall off a cliff. A year later the product has 20 customers, <strong>the same number it had a year ago</strong>. Your market, which you assumed was your niche, may in fact have been just 20 organizations. This happens with highly specific B2B software and can often kill a company that doesnâ€™t know any better.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re starting a startup itâ€™s imperative you understand the difference between your niche and your market. Build your product and #GTM for your niche, but know from the beginning how that blooms into a billion-dollar opportunity.</p>
