<p>Most people know #HIPAA from the forms they have to fill out at a doctorâ€™s office, and for most people, thatâ€™s enough. For businesses, #HIPAA can be a bit more complex. If youâ€™re working with #[[Patient Information]], specifically [[Electronic Protected Healthcare Information (ePHI)]] there are a number of #Rules a business must #comply with or they may face #Financial and #Legal #Penalties.</p>

<p>#Compliance can be relatively straight forward if a business is aware of which rules apply to their #Organization. Of course, this is the hard part. Distilling #HIPAA down into manageable components is anything but easy. Iâ€™ve spent the better part of my career helping organizations tackle compliance at scale, and itâ€™s just as difficult in #2020 as it was in #2013.</p>

<p>The problem lies not in the regulations, but in the complexities surrounding how your business functions. HIPAA is not modern, and yet thousands of modern businesses must comply with HIPAA.</p>

<h2 id="how-roam-helps">How Roam Helps</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve written aboutÂ <a href="https://rrich.substack.com/p/dark-roam">Roam</a>Â briefly, but to summarize the tool, itâ€™s note-taking for networked thought. With reference-able blocks, bi-directional links, querying, filtering, metadata support, and more. Itâ€™s the closest thing we have to re-building our brains in text.</p>

<p>As part of the work Iâ€™m doing for a newly funded venture I recently founded (yet to be announced), Iâ€™m transcribing HIPAA from the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf">static PDF</a> provided by HHS into a linked Roam database â€” with the intention of building #APIs around specific HIPAA rules, and smartly applying those rules to #Cloud and #SaaS configurations for automatically generating #Policies and #Procedures on the fly. Hereâ€™s a short demo of the database (sorry, Substack doesnâ€™t support Loom embeds) ðŸ‘‡</p>

<p>This is still very much a WIP, but if youâ€™re interested in accessing this database, please reach out to me atÂ <a href="mailto:rrichrs@gmail.com">rrichrs@gmail.com</a></p>
