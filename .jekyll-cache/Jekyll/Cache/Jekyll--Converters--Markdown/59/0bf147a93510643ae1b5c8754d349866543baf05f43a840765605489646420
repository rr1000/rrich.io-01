<p>The definition of #Design is and has always been fluid, but more so now than ever. Technology disruption forces the job of the #Designer to change at an exponential rate. At<a href="https://catalyze.io"> Catalyze</a> design has fit into the proverbial modern molding of tech companies. Product is the parent, engineering a sibling. When creating and shipping #SaaS products this structure typically works well. It is well tested and documented.</p>

<p>When creating new #Services, stratified by consulting, and building primarily system-to-system products this structure falls apart. Design becomes a larger company-wide goal, and confining it to product leaves money on the table. Because of this, weâ€™ve decided to move design under the #Revenue team. To get a better understanding of exactly what weâ€™ll be doing, hereâ€™s an example of a few of our goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ensure our brand is felt and experienced at every interaction point customers and prospects have with the organization.</strong> As a team we must have an intimate understanding of the brand. Our job is to create an identity, organize that into a system, assist in dispersion, and then reorganize those bits into a coherent voice.^^</li>
  <li><strong>Continue to mold and shape branded interactions on the product level.</strong> Moving design outside of product doesnâ€™t mean we no longer participate in product design. Quite the contrary. Now that we have a closer tie to the organization as a whole, design becomes paramount to the success of product as we bridge the gap between the market and engineering.</li>
  <li><strong>Work with teams company wide to identify inefficiencies and turn those into opportunities for revenue generation.</strong> Process, product and operational inefficiencies are common in every business. By working with individuals and teams, design will solve these inefficiencies using design-oriented thinking.</li>
</ul>

<p>These #Goals, while nebulous at this point, will all have highly developed, measurable #KPIs on the project level. Eventually, we need to get to a place where design output can be measured as a percentage of uptick.</p>

<p>Because technology moves so quickly and design is inherently fluid, tools force design to consume the jobs of others (and vise versaâ€Šâ€”â€Šweâ€™re constantly fighting to survive in the world of automation). Itâ€™s not difficult to imagine how some of these projects will manifest. They will require engineering, management, creativity, and research. As a company, weâ€™ve built these skills into the design team. In this way design is a holistic, self-sustaining studio that can function autonomously inside of the organization.</p>

<p>This is an experiment. Turning design into science is perhaps an unpopular motivation, yet for many, design defines science. Itâ€™s a way in which we can currently explain the world around us.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be documenting our findings as we explore this new way of utilizing design, both here and on the <a href="http://content.catalyze.io/blog">Catalyze company blog</a>. Stay tuned.</p>
