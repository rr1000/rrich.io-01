<p>When I first read that #Harvard would be forgoing full-time in person classes for the fall and 2021 my initial thoughts were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How does this impact graduate programs like #MBA s, where arguably the most valuable component of the degree is nepotism and networking, both have hard requirements on in-person interaction;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and two, how is #Harvard still able to justify a [[$50k+]](<a href="https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/how-aid-works">https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/how-aid-works</a> tuition price tag. That seems absolutely insane to me. Not because I donâ€™t think students can learn online. Iâ€™m a big proponent of online education (<a href="https://www.haekka.com">I co-founded an online training startup</a>), but because you go to Harvard for the #Networking. Not simply to gain an education.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
