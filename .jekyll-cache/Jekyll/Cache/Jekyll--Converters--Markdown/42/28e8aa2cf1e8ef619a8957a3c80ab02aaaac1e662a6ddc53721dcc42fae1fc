<p>Companies being funded over a tremendous amount of hype. These companies, like their ICO kin, will not survive the cycle. Aside from <a href="http://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> and other exchanges, have we seen any real breakout crypto startups? Weâ€™ve certainly seen billions in capital raised, but very few results â€” I really canâ€™t think of an example of a pure crypto play that has a significant user base let alone revenue.</p>

<p>GPT is real, just like crypto is real, but maturity is still 10 years out. I fear investors that have little understanding of the technology are hyping it up (GPT-3 isnâ€™t even generally available yet, and may never be).</p>

<p>10 years is an arbitrary amount of time. If we still donâ€™t have AGI or decentralized infrastructure in 10 years I would not be surprised at all. Societal changes need a strong forcing function. Strong forcing functions take time. Even the effects of COVID-19 are beginning to wear off (companies are abandoning remote work, moving back into offices) and thatâ€™s one of the most significant events a person can go through in a lifetime.</p>

<p>GPT-X but pre-AGI will improve work we already mostly automate today. Data entry, mech turk, even copywriting (think auto-complete today), but it wonâ€™t be eliminating entire industries overnight.</p>
