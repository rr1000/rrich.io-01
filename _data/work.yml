  description: <p>My career started by co-founding a startup that helped educators streamline their grading process with the assistance of their mobile device. Utilizing optical character recognition technology (way back before things like machine learning and AI were cool), we helped college professors drastically improve their grading times, allowing them to spend more time educating.</p><p>I’m passionate about building products at the intersection of security, privacy, and autonomy.
